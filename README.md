 I made this game as the last project in my process of remembering Unity. From now on, I'm going to make all the games I'm going to make myself. In this game, you throw pins into the big circle in the middle and when the pins hit each other, the game ends. There are 2 bugs for now. 1st bug score and replay text is too small. I forgot to fix this, it can be fixed in the canvas settings. 2. bug the score made is shown 1 more. These are easy to fix bugs. But I don't want to build the game again because it takes half an hour.
